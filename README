Cartero is at the moment a prototype for a graphical application for GNOME that
makes HTTP requests and allows to debug HTTP APIs.

Note: this project at the moment is not a complete GNOME project with a
meson.build and that stuff. Just use `cargo build` to compile the application.
Make sure you have GTK+4, GtkSourceView 5, GLib 2 and Rust 1.77 or greater.
